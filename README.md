# Industrial training project
I have worked on this Data Science project during industrial training in my B.Tech curricullam. This project contains the analysis on the given time series dataset (can be found in inside **Datasets** folder). The dataset is a small one.

# Ploting data with matplotlib and seaborn
Energy Index time series plot like following
